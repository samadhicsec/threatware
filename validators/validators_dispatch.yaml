# The mapping of validator name to python module is kept separate to the configuration of each validator as the security requirements are different
# i.e. who can specify what python code is different is likely different to who can create a new validator config that leverages an existing validator.
validators:
  string: "validators.string"
  regex: "validators.regex"
  date: "validators.date"
  template: "validators.template"
